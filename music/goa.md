# Scratch
```
Faxe Inc. – Something (Hard Acid Trance)
GMS – Juice (Full-on Psy)
Hardfloor – Acperience 1 (Trance) – The essential hard acid trance track for many.
Hallucinogen – Space Pussy (Goa/Psy)
Josh Wink – Higher State of Consciousness (Tweekin’ Acid Mix or Original) (Breaks)
Taking that acid to stratospheric frequencies!
Kopfuss Resonator and DJ Jörg – Whipbird (Goa)
Mama Indica – Radioactive Rain (Hard Acid Goa)
Misjah & Groovehead – Trippin’ Out (Rave-ish Trance)
Moonweed – Telepath (Trance)
MWNN presents Yogi and Grey One – Big Trouble in Outer Space (Dark Goa)
Best acidic dark goa track.
Phuture – Acid Trax
Plastikman – Plasticine (Minimal Techno)
Prodigy – Stand Up (Acid Breaks) – The acid that starts at 2:50 is pretty intense. Did not expect it on this album at all. I love the way it just came out of nowhere.
Pump Panel – Confusion (Techno)
Pzylo – Candy Flipping (Techno)
Razor’s Edge – Exquisite Sin (Exquisite Acid Mix) (Trance)
Riino – Brainsucker (Techno)
Solar Quest – Acidophilez album (HARD Acid Trance)
The entire album is good acid trance, but Acid Air Raid (George’s All Nighter Mix) will blow your mind, it blew mine for sure.
Space Tribe vs Electric Universe – Rabbit Hole (Full-on Psy) – Plus every single track on Thru the Looking Glass , get it!!
Spicelab – A Day on Our Planet (Trance)
Stakker – Stakker Humanoid (House)
Trilithon – Trance Dance (Goa) – I was listening to this on the Milkdrop preset Rovostar – Tripmaker (Space Trip Mix) and man, was it trippy!
Tufaan – Probe (Green Nuns of the Revolution remix) (Goa)
Uberzone – The Brain (Braindusted) (Acid Breaks)
Zodiac Youth – Fast Forward the Future (Voodoo People Mix) (Goa)
Make sure you get this mix, the Hallucinogen mix has a lot less acid.
Tracks

Various – Psychedelic Goa Core Vol. 1 (Goa Trance) – A mixed compilation that completely and totally lives up to its name, delivering a strong punch of twisted, acidic, spaced out Goa Trance. The follow up Vol. 2 and Vol. 3 are pretty good too.
Honourable Mentions

Dr. Octopus – Dr. Octopus (Trance) – This track gives a real feeling of speed, if it had only been done a little better and the acid been brought in earlier.
Robbie Long and AMS – Acid Bath (Hardcore) – This is hardcore but it has this absolutely beautiful breakdown.
C.P.U. – Acid Attack – Had the artist injected some variation and pushed a little harder this track would have been pretty good.
D.I.D. – Alcyone (Trance)
